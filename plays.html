        <h1> Basic and easy plays </h1> 
        <p> Most of the time in water polo you will usally have 6 players on the felid ( including goalie ) but most of the time if you don't have enough subs you will have 5 players out on the felid( Including goalie ). There are muiltple spots to play from. </p>
        <h2> beginning spots </h2>
        <h2> 1. Sprinter. the only player who swims to grab the ball </h2>
        <h2> 2. trailer. A player that follow the sprinter to get the ball from them. </h2>
        <h2> 3. backup-trailer. Incase the first trailer does not get the ball, he/she will take the ball instead.</h2>
        <h2> 4. any remaning players will go on the other side of the cage </h2>
        <p> once you line up in the middle there are 3 spots to play. </p>
        <h2> 1. point/center. the player that starts with the ball and throws it to teamates/ the strongest player in the center. </h2>
        <h2> 2. post's. players who line up with the goal posts to take the shot </h2>
        <h2> 3. wing's. players at the farthest away from point who are a free passing player.</h2>
        <p> Now here are some play set up's you can do </p>
        <h2> M-play </h2>
        <h2> 5 players set up to goal, the two wings set up on the side, the post go to the way back, the center goes right in front of the cage, the main goal is to pass it to center, if not the wings need to drive down and take the shot</h2>

        <h2> V-play </h2>
        <h2> 5 players set up to goal, the to wings set up on the cage post, the posts set up on more towards center, the point goes all the way to the top and you have to get the ball to a wing </h2>
        <img src="images/Screenshot (4).png" alt="v-play" >
        <h2> Dash-play </h2>
        <h2> all players go into a straight line dash to the goal, it dosen't matter what position you are at, just make a straight line to the goal. </h2>
        <img src="images/Screenshot (5).png" alt="dash-play">
        <h2> Penlty-play </h2>
        <h2> all players line up like you are taking a penlty shot. you in the center while your players stand on the sides not letting anyone in towards you so you can make the shot without anyone trying to stop you. (you want your fastest player to take the shot so they can leave their defender behind) </h2>

        <h2> Dimand-play </h2>
        <h2> You want four of your players to set up in the shape of a rombus, make sure you are far enough to were there isn't two defenders on you, you want one player to go in the direcet center of the diamond  </h2>
